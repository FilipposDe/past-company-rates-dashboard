# past-company-rates-dashboard

Dashboard to display past company rates

## Motivation

Finding wonderful businesses to invest in, requires having knowledge of past financial indicators of growth. The [Past Company Rates backend](https://github.com/FilipposDe/past-company-rates) scrapes [www.SEC.gov] and returns a set of growth indicators for US Companies. This web app was created to display this data in charts.

## Usage

Input the CIK of the company and click the GET button.

## Framework

This app was built with VanillaJS, no frameworks.
